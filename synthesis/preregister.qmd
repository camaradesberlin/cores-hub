Preregistering animal experiments means publicly recording your study’s aims, design and analysis plan before you begin. This simple step boosts transparency and reproducibility, helping reviewers identify unpublished or selective results and assess risk of bias more reliably. It also prevents needless duplication, honouring the 3Rs by reducing animal use, and lays a stronger foundation for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Ultimately, preregistration enhances the ethical and scientific rigour of preclinical research, improving its predictiveness for human studies.
