Openly disseminating research in an open and transparent manner is crucial for advancing systematic reviews and evidence-based decision making. It enables the synthesis of diverse studies, providing a comprehensive analysis of existing evidence. This transparency promotes result reproducibility and ensures an accurate assessment of knowledge on a particular topic. Accessible and synthesizable research empowers decision-makers and contributes to the development of informed policies and practices. By openly sharing methodologies, data, and outcomes, researchers create a collaborative knowledge ecosystem that fosters trust and enhances the reliability and relevance of evidence in decision-making processes.

### Open Data

#### Open Data Commons

Open Data Commons is a data sharing portal and repository for data in specific disease domains. The Open Data Commons portal:

- Share data with your colleagues in a protected space and publish data publicly with a DOI.  
- Supports compliance with the FAIR data principles to ensure data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.  
- Promotes transparency and reproducibility for our common goal to find cures for serious medical conditions.  
- Allows the community to meet increasing funder and journal data sharing requirements.
