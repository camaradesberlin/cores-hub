Openly disseminating research in a transparent manner is crucial for advancing systematic reviews and evidence-based decision making. It enables the synthesis of diverse studies, providing a comprehensive analysis of existing evidence. This transparency promotes results reproducibility and ensures an accurate assessment of knowledge on a particular topic. Accessible and synthesisable research empowers decision-makers and contributes to the development of informed policies and practices. By openly sharing methodologies, data, and outcomes, researchers create a collaborative knowledge ecosystem that fosters trust and enhances the reliability and relevance of evidence in decision-making processes.

### Open Data

#### Open Data Commons

Open Data Commons is a data sharing portal and repository for data in specific disease domains. The Open Data Commons portal:

-   Share data with your colleagues in a protected space and publish data publicly with a DOI.\
-   Supports compliance with the FAIR data principles to ensure data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.\
-   Promotes transparency and reproducibility for our common goal to find cures for serious medical conditions.\
-   Allows the community to meet increasing funder and journal data sharing requirements.

Protocols.io is a collaborative platform designed to facilitate the sharing of research protocols and methods. It serves as a centralised repository where researchers can publish, discover, and discuss experimental techniques across various scientific disciplines with ease and efficiency.

-   **Collaboration:** Enables researchers to collaborate on protocols and share expertise.

-   **Reproducibility:** Enhances the reproducibility of experiments by offering detailed, version-controlled protocols.

-   **Visibility:** Increases the visibility and impact of your research methods, as each protocol can be cited with a DOI.

-   **Experiment Tracking:** Run protocols as checklists and record changes in your File Manager, which you can choose to keep private or share.

-   **Quality Control:** Protocols are peer-reviewed, ensuring a high standard of scientific rigor.
