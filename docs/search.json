    "text": "Openly disseminating research in a transparent manner is crucial for advancing systematic reviews and evidence-based decision making. It enables the synthesis of diverse studies, providing a comprehensive analysis of existing evidence. This transparency promotes results reproducibility and ensures an accurate assessment of knowledge on a particular topic. Accessible and synthesisable research empowers decision-makers and contributes to the development of informed policies and practices. By openly sharing methodologies, data, and outcomes, researchers create a collaborative knowledge ecosystem that fosters trust and enhances the reliability and relevance of evidence in decision-making processes.\n\nOpen Data\n\nOpen Data Commons\nOpen Data Commons is a data sharing portal and repository for data in specific disease domains. The Open Data Commons portal:\n\nShare data with your colleagues in a protected space and publish data publicly with a DOI.\n\nSupports compliance with the FAIR data principles to ensure data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.\n\nPromotes transparency and reproducibility for our common goal to find cures for serious medical conditions.\n\nAllows the community to meet increasing funder and journal data sharing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ODC-SCI\n\n\n\nSpinal Cord Injury\nhttps://odc-sci.org/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ODC-TBI\n\n\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury\nhttps://odc-tbi.org/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ODC-Stroke\n\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Methods\n\nProtocols.io\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocols.io is a collaborative platform designed to facilitate the sharing of research protocols and methods.

A certificate will be provided upon successful completion of the workshop. \nATF-Stunden: This workshop accounts for 11 hours of continuing education. \n\nWe have summarized the main points of the workshop in this cheat sheet.\n\n Info & Register\n\n\n\nProtocol Development for Systematic Review of Animal Studies  This workshop will cover the contents of a transparent and comprehensive preclinical systematic review protocol. It will cover the rationale behind registering your systematic review protocol and where to register. This workshop is aimed at researchers who already have a basic understanding of systematic reviews of animal data.\n\nCourse language: English \nLocation: online via Teams \nPrerequisites: Attendance at the Introduction to Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies workshop or similar systematic review experience. \n\n\n Info & Register\n\n\n\nCritical Appraisal of Animal Studies: Practical Workshop  This interactive practical workshop explores study quality and risks of bias, internal and external validity, in scientific publications of animal experiments. Participants will gain hands-on experience critically appraising published animal experiments.\n\nCourse language: English \nLocation: online via Teams \n\n\n Info & Register\n\n\n\nIntermediate Meta-Analysis of Data From Animal Studies in R  Meta-analysis is a rigorous statistical method that systematically combines and synthesizes results from multiple independent studies. By aggregating data across multiple research outputs, meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for drawing robust conclusions, identifying patterns, and quantifying effect sizes.\nDuring this intensive workshop, participants will delve into the practicalities of conducting meta-analysis on animal studies. From understanding data types to mastering meta-regression modelling techniques, this course equips learners with practical skills to conduct robust meta-analyses. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned researcher or a curious novice, join us to develop hands-on skills in conducting meta-analysis on data from animal experiments using R.\n\nCourse language: English \nLocation: online via Teams \nECTS: no, only certificates of attendance are given \nPrerequisites: We recommend completion of the Introduction to Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies and basic familiarity with R, see meta-analysis tutorial web-application for more information. \n\n\n Info & Register\n\n\n\nAdvanced Meta-Analysis Techniques for Synthesizing Data From Animal Studies  During this advanced workshop, participants will delve into the practicalities of conducting advanced meta-analytic techniques suitable for synthesising data from animal studies, namely multi-level meta-analysis and individual animal analysis. Prior to attending this workshop, we recommend first-hand experience conducting meta-analysis of animal studies, as well as intermediate experience with R, see meta-analysis tutorial web-application for more information.\n\nCourse language: English \nLocation: online via Teams \nECTS: no, only certificates of attendance are given \n\n\n Info & Register",
