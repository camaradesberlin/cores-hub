    "text": "A systematic review is a rigorous approach to summarising multiple studies on a research question. It supports evidence-based decision making by providing an unbiased assessment of all available data. It helps identify effective interventions and reduces biases for better decision making in translational biomedicine.\nWant to learn more about systematic review? Check out our resources below!"

    "text": "Building a community around preclinical evidence synthesis At COReS, we believe in transparency, reproducibility, and the power of the community.\nTranslational failure, where promising results from preclinical studies fail to show benefit in clinical practice, is a significant challenge in biomedical research. Systematic reviews of preclinical data, a robust method of evidence synthesis, offer a critical tool to uncover factors contributing to this translational gap. Armed with these insights, researchers can design studies of high translational value. Through transparent and reproducible research practices, COReS not only address this gap but also provides a platform for learning and networking.\nWith your active participation, and the value of reproducible and open data, we can improve the quality of preclinical (animal) research together to improve translational success. Let us explain.\nEngaging with people and building communities has been vital to successful open science initiatives. That is why, we created COReS- Communities for Open Research Synthesis with a vision for it to become a strong open research community bringing together primary researchers and synthesists in the field of biomedical research. At COReS, we want to raise awareness of the importance of preclinical systematic reviews for good science. By providing a comprehensive educational strategy focusing on evidence synthesis and preclinical animal research, we equip researchers with the right skillset and impetus to plan and conduct their own systematic review projects collaboratively.\nOur missionis to connect researchers in the preclinical space through an open community that encourages and supports them in the integration of preclinical systematic review into the research pipeline.\nThe COReS community is supported by comprehensive educational resources on preclinical systematic review, as well as open access infrastructure and software."
