COReS (Communities for Open Research Synthesis) equips researchers to tackle the translational gap in biomedical research through systematic reviews of preclinical data.

- **Transparency & Reproducibility:** Open methods, open data, open code

- **Collaboration:** Shared learning, shared resources

- **Impact:** Better-designed experiments, fewer translational failures
