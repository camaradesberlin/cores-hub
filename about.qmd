## ❓ What is COReS?

COReS (Communities for Open Research Synthesis) equips researchers to tackle the translational gap in biomedical research with **systematic reviews** of preclinical data.  
- **Transparency & Reproducibility:** Open methods, open data, open code  
- **Collaboration:** Shared learning, shared resources  
- **Impact:** Better-designed experiments, fewer failed translations
