A systematic review is a rigorous approach to summarising multiple studies on a research question. It supports evidence-based decision making by providing an unbiased assessment of all available data. It helps identify effective interventions and reduces biases for better decision making in translational biomedicine.

## Protocol Development for Systematic Review of Animal Studies

This workshop will cover the contents of a transparent and comprehensive preclinical systematic review protocol. It will cover the rationale behind registering your systematic review protocol and where to register. This workshop is aimed at researchers who already have a basic understanding of systematic reviews of animal data. For more information, please click here: [Protocol Development for Systematic Review of Animal Studies](https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center/events/course/protocol-development-for-systematic-review-of-animal-studies){target="_blank"}.


## Critical Appraisal of Animal Studies

This interactive practical workshop will explore study quality and risks of bias, internal and external validity, in scientific publications of animal experiments. Participants will gain hands-on experience critically appraising published animal experiments.
