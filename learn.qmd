A **systematic review** is a rigorous method for summarising all available studies on a research question.  
- Supports evidence-based decisions by providing an unbiased assessment of all available data  
- Identifies effective interventions in translational biomedicine  
- Provides an unbiased, data-driven overview of the literature

### Protocol Development for Systematic Review of Animal Studies

This workshop will cover the contents of a transparent and comprehensive preclinical systematic review protocol. It will cover the rationale behind registering your systematic review protocol and where to register. This workshop is aimed at researchers who already have a basic understanding of systematic reviews of animal data. 

**Course language:** English
**Location:** online via Teams
**Prerequisites:** Attendance at the [Introduction to Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies](https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center/events/course/introduction-to-systematic-review-meta-analysis-of-animal-studies){target="_blank"} workshop or similar systematic review experience.

## Intermediate Meta-Analysis of Data From Animal Studies in R
Meta-analysis is a rigorous statistical method that systematically combines and synthesizes results from multiple independent studies. By aggregating data across multiple research outputs, meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for drawing robust conclusions, identifying patterns, and quantifying effect sizes. 

During this intensive workshop, participants will delve into the practicalities of conducting meta-analysis on animal studies. From understanding data types to mastering meta-regression modelling techniques, this course equips learners with practical skills to conduct robust meta-analyses. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned researcher or a curious novice, join us to develop hands-on skills in conducting meta-analysis on data from animal experiments using R. 

**Course language:** English
**Location:** online via Teams
**Prerequisites:**  We recommend completion of the [Introduction to Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies](https://www.bihealth.org/en/translation/innovation-enabler/quest-center/events/course/introduction-to-systematic-review-meta-analysis-of-animal-studies){target="_blank"} and basic familiarity with R, see [meta-analysis tutorial web-application](https://camarades.shinyapps.io/R-MA-Tutorial/){target="_blank"} for more information.
