**Welcome to the COReS Community!**\
Building a transparent, reproducible network around preclinical evidence synthesis.

## What is COReS?

COReS (Communities for Open Research Synthesis) equips researchers to tackle the translational gap in biomedical research with **systematic reviews** of preclinical data.\
- **Transparency & Reproducibility:** Open methods, open data, open code\
- **Collaboration:** Shared learning, shared resources\
- **Impact:** Better-designed experiments, fewer failed translations
